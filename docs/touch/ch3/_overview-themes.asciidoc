=== Overview Themes

==== Base Theme
When creating your own theme, you typically wouldn't extend
from Base, although it is possible.

When you extend from Base, you have to style every Sencha Touch
component yourself. It will cost you more time but the
result is that you have a fully custom theme.

It contains the bare minimum set of CSS rules that are absolutely required for Ext JS Components and Layouts to work correctly.

The *Base* Theme is subclassed by all other themes.

Then build the app:
