* Implementing an image by using the +html+ tag.
Easy but dirty. 
* Implementing an image by using +Ext.Img+ class.
Very powerful.
* Implementing a background image in the CSS
Structured.

==== Image HTML tag

[source, javascript]
----
items: [{
    xtype: 'container',
    html: '<img src="resources/logo.png" height="25" alt="ExtReader"/>'
}]
----

==== Image Ext.Img class

[source, javascript]
----
items:[{
	xtype: 'image',
    src: 'resources/logo.png',
    alt: 'ExtReader',
    height: 25
}]
----

==== Background image in CSS

.In Ext JS view:
[source, javascript]
----
items: [{
    xtype: 'container',
    cls: 'mybackground'
}]
----

.In Sass:
[source, javascript]
----
.mybackground {
	background: #fff url('background.png') repeat-x;
}
----


==== Base64 encode instead
Images can be saved to Base64 strings. (Binary to ASCII Text). 
It's a technique what's been used for years for sending email 
image attachments. When you are not familiair with Base64 strings, they look like these:

[source, javascript]
----
data:image/png;base64,<LONG BASE64 STRING WITH ENCODED DATA>"
----

An advantage of a string like this, is that you can cache it,
maybe you want to save it in a database.
Instead of an URL to a path you pass in the Base-64 string.
