==== Comments
With Sass it is possible to write single line comments.
These files won't be compiled in your CSS output.
Though multiline comments will.

.app.scss
[source, javascript]
----
//These lines of comments
//won't be visibile in my CSS file

/* but this line will.
----

.app.css
[source, javascript]
----
/* but this line will. */
----

==== File structure
To create structure in your Stylesheets, you can use the +@import+ code.

In CSS +@import+ downloads the CSS files after each other (not in parrallel)
that makes a performance hit.

This is not the case with Sass. Since Sass compiles the Stylesheet
on the clientside. Your output will be just one single CSS file.
