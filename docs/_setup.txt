=== Java Run-time environment
Download Java 7 JDK and run the installer
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

=== Sencha Cmd
With Sencha Cmd you can start scaffolding a new project, minifying and deploying your application to production. In case you have the old Sencha SDK tools installed please remove it.

Download Sencha Cmd and run the installer: +
http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download

Remember where you installed the Sencha Cmd directory and the version number you
are using. By default, the installation path is: +
Windows: `C:\Users\Me\bin\Sencha\Cmd\{cmd-vers}` +
Mac OS X: `~/bin/Sencha/Cmd/{cmd-vers}` +
Linux: `~/bin/Sencha/Cmd/{cmd-vers}` +

.Optional
Enter the following command in your console or terminal: `sencha`.
It should prompt all the Sencha commands and options.
In case you don't see anything you can close your terminal and you will need to add Sencha Cmd to your class path:

*Windows users*: +
`Start > Control Panel > Performance and Maintenance > System` +
In your system properties click on the `Advanced` tab. +
Click the `Environment Variables` button.
Edit the `classpath` variable or create a new variable called: `classpath`
Add the following value and save: +
`C:\Users\Me\bin\Sencha\Cmd\{cmd-vers}` +
Make sure you are entering the correct path and version number.

*Mac users*: +
Make hidden files visible.
To achieve this, type the following command in your terminal: +
`defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE` +
`killall Finder` +
(running these commands with +FALSE+ will hide the files again)
Now open _~.bash_profile_. +
Add the following commands and save the file: +
`export PATH=/Users/username/bin/Sencha/Cmd/{cmd-vers}:$PATH`  +
Make sure you are entering the correct path and version number.

=== Sencha Architect 3.0
Download the installer for the preview version from:
http://sc13-live.sencha.com/

Run the installer, and login by using the (or creating) Sencha forum ID.

=== IDE or Editor
You can use any IDE or Editor you like. 
I'm using: Sublime Text (for it\' simplicity) - http://www.sublimetext.com/

TIP: I recommend that your editor includes JavaScript syntax checking similar to JSLint.

=== Modern browser
Sencha Touch requires you use a modern browser, like Google Chrome, Safari, IE10 or Firefox 24+
I prefer Safari or Google Chrome.
To install Google Chrome just download and run the installer:
https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

=== Ruby, Sass and Compass
Check if Ruby, Sass or Compass is installed with the following commands for the
command line: +
+ruby -v+ +
+compass -v+ +
+sass -v+ +
It should prompt you with a version number.
If it does not output a version number you will need to install it.

To install Sass and Compass to your development environment, you will need to have Ruby installed. This is automatically installed for Mac OS X users. Windows users can download and run the installer from:  http://rubyinstaller.org
(Do not download the Ruby 2.x version.)

.To install Sass and Compass for Windows:
Enter the following commands in the command line:
+gem install compass+ +
Wait until the process is completed. It will take a few minutes before the 
command completes and the command prompt returns. +
+gem install sass -v 3.1.1+
Wait until the process is completed

.To install Sass and Compass for Mac OS X:
Enter the following commands in the command line:
+sudo gem install compass+ +
Wait until the process is completed. It will take a few minutes before the 
command completes and the command prompt returns. +
+sudo gem install sass -v 3.1.1+
Wait until the process is completed
