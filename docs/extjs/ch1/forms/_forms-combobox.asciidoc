==== What is it?
A ComboBox control (is like a select dropdown) with support for autocomplete, remote loading, and many other features.

A ComboBox is like a combination of a traditional HTML text <input> field and a <select> field; the user is able to type freely into the field, and/or pick values from a dropdown selection list. The user can input any value by default, even if it does not appear in the selection list.
