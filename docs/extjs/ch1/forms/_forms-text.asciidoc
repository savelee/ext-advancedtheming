=== Textfield

==== What is it?
A plain form field for entering text.

But there is one important difference.
A (text) field in Ext JS is the input field plus the label all together.

Under the hood all fields are little html tables.
Where the label is the left +<td>+.
The field is the 2nd +<td>+.
Optionally the 3rd +<td>+ contains a trigger button.
