<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>With Sass it is possible to write single line comments.
These files won&#8217;t be compiled in your CSS output.
Though multiline comments will.</p>
<pre class="runnable preview">//These lines of comments
//won't be visibile in my CSS file

/* but this line will.</pre>
<pre class="runnable preview">/* but this line will. */</pre>


<h2>File structure</h2>
<p>To create structure in your Stylesheets, you can use the <code>@import</code> code.</p>
<p>In CSS <code>@import</code> downloads the CSS files after each other (not in parrallel)
that makes a performance hit.</p>
<p>This is not the case with Sass. Since Sass compiles the Stylesheet
on the clientside. Your output will be just one single CSS file.</p>
