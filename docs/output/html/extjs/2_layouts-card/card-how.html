<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Since only one panel is displayed at a time, the only way to move from one Component to the next is by calling <code>setActiveItem()</code> on the layout of the Container, passing the next panel to display (or its id or index). The layout itself does not provide a user interface for handling this navigation, so that functionality must be provided by the developer.</p>
