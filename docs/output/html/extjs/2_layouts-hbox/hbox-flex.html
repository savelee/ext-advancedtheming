<h2>Flex</h2>
<p>To create dynamic (flexible) widths.</p>
<p>Let’s say, if you have a container.  And the left panel takes up 25% height. And the right panel takes up 75%. (that’s together 100%).
In this case, we could say 25% is one 1/4 And 75% is 3/4.
So 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
<p>In that case the left panel would have <code>flex: 1</code>.
The right panel would have <code>flex: 3</code>.</p>
