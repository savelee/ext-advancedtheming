<!-- Chapter: Spinnerfield -->


<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>A field with a pair of up/down spinner buttons. This class is not normally instantiated directly, instead it is subclassed and the onSpinUp and onSpinDown methods are implemented to handle when the buttons are clicked. A good example of this is the Ext.form.field.Number field which uses the spinner to increment and decrement the field&#8217;s value by its step config value.</p>
