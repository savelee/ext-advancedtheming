==== Flex

To create dynamic (flexible) widths.

Let’s say, if you have a container.  And the left panel takes up 25% height. And the right panel takes up 75%. (that’s together 100%).
In this case, we could say 25% is one 1/4 And 75% is 3/4.
So 1 + 3 = 4.

In that case the left panel would have +flex: 1+.
The right panel would have +flex: 3+.
