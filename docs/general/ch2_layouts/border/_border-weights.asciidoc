===== Weights
The region weight determine the priority / weight of each column.
(You can compare this with HTML tables, where you could set rowspan and colspan, to stretch out columns or rows (although these layouts are of course no tables.)

It works a bit like in CSS where you have Z-index.  An element with a greater stack order is always in front of element with a lower stack order. Who is the boss of the spot.
There is just one spot. â€“ And you stack on top of each other.

Now with a border layout, you have to check who is the boss over one of the 4 spots.
The four spots are the corners.
