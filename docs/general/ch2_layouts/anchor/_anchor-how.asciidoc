==== How it works
Specify one String where the first percentage points to the width
(relative to the container's dimensions) and the second percentage to
the height.

It is possible to enter pixels. A negative pixel value will deduct the
amount of pixels from the 100% container height or width.
A positive pixel value will add it on top of the 100% (which usually don't make sense).
