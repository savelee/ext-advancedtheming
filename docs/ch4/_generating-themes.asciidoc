Generating custom themes
-------------------------

=== Objectives
* Learn how to generate themes
* Understand the package folder structure
* Learn how to extend from Sencha themes

=== Generating themes
When you want to create a new custom theme, you can
generate a starting point with Sencha Cmd.

==== About the Command Line
Sencha Cmd is a tool on the command line (CLI).
You will use your Windows Console or Mac Terminal for this.

.Windows
* *Start* > *Run* 
* Type: +cmd+ and press _ok_ 

.Mac OSX
* *Applications* > *Utils* > *Terminal*

==== About Sencha Cmd
.Sencha Cmd is a command-line tool that makes it quick and easy to do several application-development tasks.
* Generate commands
** Generate workspaces
** Generate apps
** Generate themes
** and more...
* Build-in webserver
* Build tools

==== Generate a theme

[source, javascript]
----
sencha generate theme MyTheme
----

This will generate a theme for the package folder structure.

==== Package folder structure
The folder structure of a theme looks like this:

.[workspace/root folder]/packages/mytheme/
* package.json
This is the package properties file. It tells Sencha Cmd certain things about the package like its name, version, and dependencies (other packages that it requires).
* build
The build of the theme
* overrides
This directory contains any JavaScript overrides to Ext JS Component classes that may be required for theming those Components.
* resources
This directory contains images and other static resources that your theme requires.
* sass
** etc +
	contains additional utility functions or mixins
** src +
	contains Sass rules and UI mixins
** var +
	contains Sass variables

=== Extending themes
A new generated theme always extends from the *Classic* theme.

When you want to inherit from the *Neptune* theme instead
you will need to change the +extend+.

==== Change the extend
To change the inheritance of the custom theme. Open
_/packages/MyTheme/package.json_

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "name": "MyTheme",
    "type": "theme",
    "creator": "Lee Boonstra",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "compatVersion": "1.0.0",
    "local": true,
    "requires": [],
    "extend": "ext-theme-neptune" //ext-theme-classic
}
----

==== Refresh the app
You now need to refresh your application.

This ensures that the correct theme JavaScript files are included in the application's "bootstrap.js" file so that the application can be run in development mode. 

Run from the app directory the following command:

[source, javascript]
----
sencha app refresh
----
