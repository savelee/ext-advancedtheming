. *The last step is to create some custom styles for the tree panel*
+
As you can see, the tree is already styled. This is because the treepanel extends from +Ext.panel.Table+ and +Ext.panel.Table+, therefore it reuses a lot of the same styles as the grid does. Letâ€™s write our own custom styles
+
Take over the below CSS code and use Sass nesting 
http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/#nesting for readability:
+
[[code4_nesting]]
.Tree Panel code, take this code over and start nesting
====
[source, HTML]
----
.x-tree-panel .x-tree-icon,
.x-tree-panel .x-tree-elbow-img {
    display: none;
}
.x-tree-panel .x-grid-cell {
    background: $white;
}

.x-tree-panel .x-grid-row-selected .x-grid-td {
    background: white;
}
.x-tree-panel .x-grid-row-selected .x-tree-node-text {
    font-weight: bold;
}
.x-tree-panel .x-grid-row-selected {
    color: red;
}
----
====

. *Compile and preview your stylessheet*
+ 
By now you should see your own custom tree panel, with white background cells. If you want to take a peek into the solution files, check the following file: _/packages/Lab4Solution/sass/etc/all.scss_
When you want to test this solution theme, just switch themes in your _extreader/.sencha/app/sencha.cfg_, set +app.theme+ to +Lab4Solution+ (+app.theme=Lab4Solution+) and run a +sencha app build+.
